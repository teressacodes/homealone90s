Always and Forever Home Alone<br />
[Visit the Site here - HomeAlone90s](https://homealone90s.teressaellison.com/) <br /> 
This "Home Alone" 90s retro project is a nostalgic tribute to the classic movie, featuring a playful and interactive website that channels the vibrant, pixelated aesthetics of the 1990s. <br />
The project highlights various elements inspired by the film, including a pizza ordering page for the fictional "Little Nero's" pizza place, a page where visitors can contact Kevin's parents, <br />
and links to iconic scenes, such as the "Angels with Filthy Souls" video clip Kevin used to defend his home.<br />
<br />
Key technologies used in the project include:
-HTML for the structure
-CSS for styling with custom animations and retro fonts (including the iconic "Press Start 2P" font) <br />
-Vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements, such as the "like" form, dynamic cursor trail effects, and an audio clip of Kevin’s famous line, "I made my family disappear!"<br />
-Giphy for embedding GIFs, which showcase memorable moments from the movie, like Kevin jumping on the bed as well as Harry and Marv’s hilarious falls.<br />
<br />
One of the standout features of the website is the under-construction GIF on the Little Nero page. This intentional design choice not only enhances the retro 90s vibe but also adds authenticity, <br />
given that Little Nero's is not real. The contact page provides an opportunity for visitors to interact and recalls them to the moment where Kate McCallister realizes they’ve forgotten Kevin and <br />
promptly sits up in her seat! Additionally, the link to the Home Alone house takes visitors to a Google Maps location of the real house used in the movie, located in Chicago, adding a fun, <br />
real-world connection to the project. The "Filthy Angels" video link featured on the site is the actual fictional movie clip that Kevin uses to scare off the robbers.<br />
<br />
The project posed challenges such as maintaining the visual aesthetic of the 90s while ensuring interactive elements worked smoothly across different devices. <br />
The implementation of pixelated cursor trails and retro animations helped to create the desired nostalgic effect.<br />
